# F104AutoPilot
I created a basic autopilot to control basic variables of the military type aircraft F-104 "Starfighter". I used Nelson's Flight Stability and Automatic Control book for source.
After doing mathematical calculations to calculate aerodynamical coefficients and stability variables, I used these numbers for creation of the transfer functions. These transfer 
functions are in lateral mode and in longitudinal mode. By using Inner-Outer Loop method by Nelson (p.322), I find the important feedback gain values and implemented them into my
transfer functions. The results can be seen in the report.
